# swift-learning-mind-map-notes
When I was new to Swift, I wrote mind map notes to help me learn the Swift language and SwiftUI faster. It helped me a lot while I was learning, so I decided to share them. Some of the notes will not be updated in the future, but writing them has been helpful to me in the past.
# These notes contain the Chinese language.

# swift-learning-mind-map-notes
When I was new to Swift, I wrote mind map notes to help me learn the Swift language and SwiftUI faster. It helped me a lot while I was learning, so I decided to share them. Some of the notes will not be updated in the future, but writing them has been helpful to me in the past.
### Some of the notes contain the Chinese language.

####Mind map notes generally help me to learn faster. They only contain contents that I consider I will forget or need to learn in the future. I write them based on my understanding and the organizational method is only for my personal use, so it may be hard for others to understand.
